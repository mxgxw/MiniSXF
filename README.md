MiniSXF - Copyright (c) 2012-2013 - by Mario Gomez - version 0.1

Introduction
---------------------
MiniSXF is a sightly modified version of MiniZip 1.1  that is built
from MiniZip 1.0 by Gilles Vollant ( http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html )

Original note: When adding ZIP64 support into minizip it would result
into risk of breaking compatibility with minizip 1.0.
All possible work was done for compatibility.

Note: Appears that fopen in cygwin already supports large files, so 
there is no needed to call fopen64.

Background
---------------------
There isn't a simple way to generate self extracting files on linux
web servers that can be run on Windows systems without executing external
commands.

Many hosting services doesn't allow you to run external commands, so I
need a solution that allows me to generate a self extracting file
programmaticaly without executing any externals commands in PHP.

This simple executable just try to find the data appended to itself and
extract the zipfile using the MiniZip routines.

This is a really "beta experimental version". It could have a lot of
bugs because I tried to remove all the code to make it compile under
cygwin.

The original source code can be found on:
